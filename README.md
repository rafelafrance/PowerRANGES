Rule-based trait parsers supporting the RANGES project


Would you please help me with these abbreviations, I forgot what they mean: oel, oml, osl, cen, cmn, csn, oen, cmn, dsn, oen, omn, & osn.  I'm trying to decide what category to throw them into: lactation (pos/neg) or nipple state/enlargement (pos/neg). I'm guessing that the ending "L" is for lactation and the ending "N" is for not. But I'm not really sure.

Yeah, they are codes for
1-vagina perforation (open, closed)
2-nipple size (small, med, large/enlarged)
3-lactating (y/n)

So they cut across 3 traits
